Our approach is open and collaborative, bringing together a range of stakeholders, including public sector entities, the private sector, academia and civil society organizations. We develop, test, and iterate upon formats that generate public value in new ways.

To collaborate more effectively towards impact, practitioners require specific skills and capacities. We offer tailor-made executive trainings for the public, the private and the nonprivate sector (Executive Education). As part of our teaching activities we prepare, educate and empower students to be changemakers (Teaching). In-depth knowledge about how to achieve impact is key and builds the basis of all our activities. We conduct research in relevant fields of social innovation (Research). The creation and implementation of new solutions and approaches requires innovative and collaboratives formats. We develop and test formats that generate public values in new ways (Innovation). By engaging in networking and providing a platform, we promote sharing of experiences and securing knowledge transfer between the different sectors. We are dedicated to spread the word about social innovation to the broader public.
