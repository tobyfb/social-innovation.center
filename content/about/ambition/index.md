summary: >-
  To address the global challenges of our time, the United Member States
  formulated the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a universal reference
  framework for everyone, including industrialized and developing countries,
  civil society as well as the private sector. The SDGs signify a paradigm shift
  away from development aid from the rich to the poor and can only be achieved
  with the engagement of all players and collaboration across sectors.


  We at CSI-HSG aim at contributing to an accelerated and intensified achievement of the SDGs. We help people and organizations to develop a common mindset and work more effectively towards impact, by increasing their know-how and capabilities for collaboration and bridging rationalities.
