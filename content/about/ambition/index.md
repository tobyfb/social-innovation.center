To address the global challenges of our time, the United Member States formulated the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a universal reference framework for everyone, including industrialized and developing countries, civil society as well as the private sector. The SDGs signify a paradigm shift away from development aid from the rich to the poor and can only be achieved with the engagement of all players and collaboration across sectors.

We at CSI-HSG aim at contributing to an accelerated and intensified achievement of the SDGs. We help people and organizations to develop a common mindset and work more effectively towards impact, by increasing their know-how and capabilities for collaboration and bridging rationalities.
