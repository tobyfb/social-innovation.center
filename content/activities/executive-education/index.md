Bridging rationalities between sectors and creating and implementing impact-oriented business models and innovative financing models requires people and organizations that have the proper capabilities to do so. That is why executive education of practitioners is crucial. Based on the fact that each sector has a different primary logic there are different needs when it comes to skills and capability development. As a result, CSI-HSG will develop sector or even organization-specific training offerings. Executive education programs for the private sector, the non-profit sector, the public sector and the donor agencies are planned.
