The development and implementation of impact-oriented solutions requires innovative formats and approaches as well as business and financial models. CSI-HSG develops, tests and applies innovative and collaborative methods to generate solutions for sustainable impact. For this purpose, we pursue an open approach, bringing together public sector entities, the private sector and civil society organizations. CSI-HSG develops tailor-made formats addressing specific needs and challenges of public sector entities, companies or non-profit organizations and provides process support as well as technical expertise.
