In-depth knowledge about how to achieve impact forms the basis of all CSI-HSG activities and is therefore key. We conduct research in relevant fields of social innovation and impact-driven entrepreneurship with the aim of shaping the practice and the international debate on achieving the SDGs. The research activities include the development of conceptual foundation of CSI-HSG as well as basic and field research in key areas.
